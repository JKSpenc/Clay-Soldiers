# This is a fork of [Matthews Clay Soldiers Mod](https://github.com/matthewperiut/Clay-Soldiers)

The goal is to create a fully functional Clay Soldiers like we had it in 1.7.10 or so.

Since all the rights reserved to this person, i cant publish any code until the maintainer gives permissions, so you need to build it yourself in order to get updates :)
